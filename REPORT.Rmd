# Introduction and Strategy

# Implementation

## 1. Argument management

The program starts by validating its command-line arguments. The number of expected events must be passed when executing the program. If the input is missing or invalid (not a positive number), the program prints an error message and exits. This ensures proper usage from the user side.

## 2. Generation of events

## 3. Consuming events

# System Tasks
